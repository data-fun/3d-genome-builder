# Genome 3D models visualization

3D models are a list of beads with x, y and z coordinates. This list is stored as a .pdb and a .g3d files. 3d-genome-builder output structures can thus be opened in molecular viewers (e.g. Pymol, NGLViewer or Mol*) or specialized 3d genome structures viewers (e.g. WashU and HiC3D-Viewer).

## How to open a 3d genome structure .pdb file with Mol*

The detailed manual of Mol* is available [here](https://molstar.org/viewer-docs/).

1- To load the 3d model, click on the "open file" command on the left menu. Select your .pdb file then click on apply.

2- To see the 3d model in a molecular design in beads click on the "illustrative" Quick Styles on the right menu.

3- To change the background color or turn off the outline, use the menu on the right corner of the central interface.

4- To change the structure's color, click on component "all" menu, then on "set coloring" and choose the appropriate parameter.


## How to open a 3d genome structure .g3d file with HiC3D-Viewer

The detailed manual of HiC3D-Viewer is available [here](https://github.com/mohamed-amine-guerras/HiC3DViewer/blob/master/hicViewer/static/data/UserManual.pdf).

1- To load the 3d model, click on the "select file" command of the "Upload 3D model" menu. Select your .g3d file then click on submit. After the import of the model, select it in the "Load built model" menu then click on OK. 

2- To change chromosomes colors and thickness or hide the axes, use the right menu.
